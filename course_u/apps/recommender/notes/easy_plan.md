

Jobs Skills Contents are based on Nakuri Jobs  01st Jul 2019 - 30th Aug 2019 

Skills List contains the overall frequency from Jobs Skills

Once, new Jobs were scraped or gathered

the Frequency should change

On Nakuri Jobs, 
The jobs are what is recommended

What we want is called Specialization, this is the sub from Fields.

The closest data (column) for Specialization from Nakuri Jobs is the Role Field

So each jobs belongs to a Specialization

In our Recommender we should get the number of recommended Specialization for each Field

Then we will get the Top 3 Fields and recommend it to the user

Based on your understanding of the provided text, here are some suggestions, recommendations, and observations to consider:

**Suggestions:**

* **Consider using a more granular approach to Specialization:** Instead of simply recommending top 3 Fields, consider breaking down each Field into more specific Specializations. This would allow for more personalized recommendations that align closely with user skills and preferences.

* **Incorporate user feedback and engagement:** Collect feedback from users about the recommended Specializations and adjust the ranking algorithm accordingly. This feedback can help refine the system and improve its accuracy over time.

* **Explore alternative recommendation strategies:** While focusing on skills and Specializations is a sound approach, consider exploring alternative recommendation strategies, such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering. These techniques can complement the skill-based approach and provide additional insights for personalized recommendations.

**Recommendations:**

* **Establish a frequency update schedule:** Define a regular frequency for updating the skill frequency data based on the rate at which new job postings are being gathered. This ensures that the recommendation system remains up-to-date with the latest job market trends.

* **Implement a skill similarity algorithm:** Utilize a skill similarity algorithm to identify related skills and group them into clusters. This can be useful for broadening search queries, suggesting alternative skills to users, and improving the overall personalization of recommendations.

* **Track user engagement and conversion rates:** Monitor how users engage with the recommended Specializations, such as clicking on the links or applying for jobs. This data can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the recommendation system and identify areas for improvement.

**Observations:**

* **Skill frequency may not be the sole factor for accurate recommendations:** While skill frequency is an important factor, it's crucial to consider other factors like user experience, job descriptions, and employer information to provide comprehensive and relevant recommendations.

* **Continuous improvement and adaptation are essential:** Recommendation systems should be designed to continuously adapt to changes in the job market, user preferences, and industry trends. Regularly evaluate and refine the system to maintain its effectiveness.

* **User satisfaction and trust are paramount:** Ensure that the recommendation system provides users with relevant, personalized, and valuable suggestions. Prioritize user satisfaction to build trust and enhance the overall user experience.
