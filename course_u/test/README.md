# Testing Django

##### Why should you test?
- higher application quality
- easier refactoring
- easier version upgrades

**Unit Tests**
- test one function or class at a time
- test the smallest unit of code possible
- fast to write and run

**Integration Test**
- test multiple pieces together to assure they work together

**Functional Tests**
- test that everythings works from the end-user's point of view
- slow to write and run
