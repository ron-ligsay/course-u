# 2. Transactions:

# Transactions are crucial for ensuring data integrity and consistency in your application. Django has built-in support for transactions.

# Database Transactions: Use Django's transaction module to manage database transactions. Wrap database operations within a with transaction.atomic(): block to ensure all or nothing commits.

# Concurrency Control: Implement proper concurrency control mechanisms to prevent conflicts when multiple users or processes modify the same data simultaneously. Use Django's F() objects for atomic updates.
