# Report Generation: Generate reports as HTML, PDF, or other formats using libraries like ReportLab or WeasyPrint. 
# You can create custom views or use Django packages like django-report-builder for more advanced reporting capabilities.


# Scheduled Reporting: Use scheduled tasks (e.g., Celery) to automatically generate 
# and send reports at specified intervals to users or administrators.
