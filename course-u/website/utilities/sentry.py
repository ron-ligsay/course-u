# 2. Setting Up Monitoring:

# For monitoring, you can use third-party services like Sentry or New Relic. Here's how to set up Sentry as an example:

# 2.1. Install the Sentry SDK:

# You need to install the sentry-sdk package:

# bash
# Copy code
# pip install sentry-sdk
# 2.2. Configure Sentry in settings.py:

# Add the Sentry configuration to your settings.py:

# python
# Copy code
# import sentry_sdk
# from sentry_sdk.integrations.django import DjangoIntegration

# sentry_sdk.init(
#     dsn='YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
#     integrations=[DjangoIntegration()],
#     traces_sample_rate=1.0,  # Set the sample rate for performance monitoring
# )
# Replace 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN' with your actual Sentry DSN, which you obtain from your Sentry account.

# 3. Testing and Usage:

# To test your logging and monitoring setup, you can intentionally raise exceptions in your code and verify that the log entries appear in your logs and in your monitoring tool (e.g., Sentry). You can also set up alerts and notifications within your monitoring tool to stay informed about issues in real-time.

# In addition to the basic setup described here, you can further customize and enhance your logging and monitoring by exploring advanced features and integration with external services based on your specific needs.
